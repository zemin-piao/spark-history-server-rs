# Script Organization - Migration Summary

This document summarizes the reorganization of bash scripts in the Spark History Server project.

## Changes Made

### 📁 **Created Scripts Directory**
All bash scripts have been moved from the project root to a dedicated `scripts/` directory for better organization.

### 🔄 **Scripts Moved**

| Original Location | New Location | Purpose |
|-------------------|--------------|---------|
| `run-hdfs-tests.sh` | `scripts/run-hdfs-tests.sh` | Comprehensive HDFS integration testing |
| `run_hdfs_tests.sh` | `scripts/run_hdfs_tests.sh` | Legacy HDFS test runner (deprecated) |
| `run_integration_tests.sh` | `scripts/run_integration_tests.sh` | End-to-end integration testing |
| `run_load_tests.sh` | `scripts/run_load_tests.sh` | Load testing and performance validation |
| `test-hdfs-args.sh` | `scripts/test-hdfs-args.sh` | HDFS CLI demonstration script |

### 📝 **Documentation Updates**

Updated all references to the moved scripts in:
- `README.md` - Main project documentation
- `LOAD_TESTING.md` - Load testing guide
- `HDFS_INTEGRATION.md` - HDFS integration guide

### 📚 **Added Scripts Documentation**
Created `scripts/README.md` with comprehensive documentation including:
- Purpose of each script
- Usage examples
- Environment variable configuration
- Development guidelines
- Troubleshooting tips

## Usage After Migration

### Quick Reference
```bash
# HDFS Integration Tests
./scripts/run-hdfs-tests.sh

# Load Testing
./scripts/run_load_tests.sh

# Integration Tests  
./scripts/run_integration_tests.sh

# HDFS CLI Demo
./scripts/test-hdfs-args.sh
```

### All Scripts Remain Executable
All scripts maintain their executable permissions and functionality.

## Benefits of This Organization

### 🎯 **Improved Project Structure**
- Cleaner project root directory
- Logical grouping of related functionality
- Easier navigation for developers

### 📖 **Better Documentation**
- Centralized script documentation in `scripts/README.md`
- Clear purpose and usage for each script
- Development guidelines for adding new scripts

### 🔧 **Easier Maintenance**
- All testing scripts in one location
- Consistent naming and organization
- Simplified script discovery

### 🚀 **Enhanced Developer Experience**
- Clear separation between source code and tooling
- Dedicated documentation for each script
- Environment variable guidance

## Backward Compatibility

### ⚠️ **Breaking Changes**
Scripts can no longer be run from the project root with `./script-name.sh`. 

### ✅ **New Usage Pattern**
All scripts must now be run with the `scripts/` prefix:
```bash
# Old way (no longer works)
./run-hdfs-tests.sh

# New way (correct)
./scripts/run-hdfs-tests.sh
```

### 📚 **Updated Documentation**
All documentation has been updated to reflect the new script locations.

## Migration Verification

### ✅ **Completed Tasks**
- [x] Moved all 5 bash scripts to `scripts/` directory
- [x] Updated all references in README.md
- [x] Updated all references in LOAD_TESTING.md  
- [x] Updated all references in HDFS_INTEGRATION.md
- [x] Created comprehensive scripts/README.md
- [x] Verified scripts work from new location
- [x] All scripts maintain executable permissions

### 🧪 **Testing Status**
- All scripts tested and working correctly from new location
- No functionality changes - only location migration
- All original features and capabilities preserved

## Future Development

### 📝 **Adding New Scripts**
When adding new scripts:
1. Place in `scripts/` directory
2. Make executable: `chmod +x scripts/new-script.sh`
3. Update `scripts/README.md` with documentation
4. Follow established naming conventions

### 🔄 **Script Maintenance**
- All script maintenance should be done in `scripts/` directory
- Update documentation when adding new features
- Consider deprecating old scripts rather than maintaining duplicates

## Related Files

- `scripts/README.md` - Comprehensive script documentation
- `README.md` - Updated project documentation with new script paths
- `LOAD_TESTING.md` - Load testing guide with updated script references
- `HDFS_INTEGRATION.md` - HDFS integration guide with updated references

## Rollback Information

If rollback is needed:
```bash
# Move scripts back to root (not recommended)
mv scripts/*.sh ./
rmdir scripts/
# Then revert documentation changes
```

However, the new organization is recommended for better project structure and maintainability.
